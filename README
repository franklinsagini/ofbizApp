Welcome to vergesacco!

All you need to run OFBiz is a 1.6 (version 6) JDK
(not just the JRE, the full JDK).
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

You can load the demo data with the following command on the command line
from the OFBiz home folder (in Unix-like operating systems
type "./ant" rather than "ant"):

ant load-demo

Then start vergesacco:

ant start

(or "java -Xms128M -Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -jar ofbiz.jar")

Once vergesacco starts, you can look at the demo at:
http://localhost:8443/loans

and the administration interface at:
https://localhost:8443/webtools

You can log in with the user "admin" and password "ofbiz".

To stop vergesacco:

ant stop
